        The purpose of Projectplace API is to provide programmatic access
        to all core functionality of Projectplace.com. The API does not yet
        cover all functionality but the coverage is continously expanding.
        Since our customers pay for using our service we belive that we should
        provide them with the option to build ontop of it to further boost
        productivity, reliability and efficiency in their processes.
        
        This library provide the basic infrastructure required to access the
        functionality: General request and authentication handling.
